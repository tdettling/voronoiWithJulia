Approximate Voronoi Diagram Calculation in Julia

This article explains the main ideas behind the software described here:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4554342

This is the abstract:
"A parallel algorithm to compute a discrete approximation to the Voronoi diagram is presented. 
The algorithm, which executes in single instruction multiple data (SIMD) mode, 
was implemented on a high-end graphics processing unit (GPU) using NVIDIA's 
compute unified device architecture (CUDA) development environment. 
The performance of the resulting code is investigated and presented, 
and a mathematical model is developed that predicts the performance of the algorithm."

This web site allows the user to generate a Voronoi diagram interactively:
